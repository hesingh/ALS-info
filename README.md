# Diagnosed with ALS?

## Next Step

Likely, an EMG test and other limb or bulbar physical tests concluded one has ALS.
But still, get your blood tested for gene mutation. Any one of many
gene mutatations in one's body cause ALS.  The C9orf72 gene is the
most common gene causing ALS.  A blood test for it takes about
3-4 weeks. Other genes causing ALS are SOD1 and FUS, there are
many more.  Speed of ALS research is picking up. The C9orf72 gene
mutation was discovered in 2011.  A test for this
mutation was developed in 2012 by Athena Diagnostics in the U.S.
and Phase I gene drug trials started in 2019.

## Tested Positive for Gene Mutation?

SOD1 has a gene silencing drug from https://apic-bio.com/, a
company in MA with Dr. Robert Brown as one founder.  Dr. Brown
discovered the SOD1 gene around 1992 to cause ALS.  He has
been working tirelessly on finding cures for ALS. Merit Cudkowicz
has been a student of Dr. Brown's.  In 2006, gene silencing, invented
at UMass Medical, got the Nobel prize in medicine.  In 2008, Dr. Brown
left Harvard Medical and joined UMass Medical - familial ALS is caused by 
gene mutation and gene silencing knowledge at UMass Medical would help. 
See Dr. Brown's research on ALS below.

Dr. Brown is first with a mRNA drug for SOD1 gene mutation.
mRNA is also being used for Covid-19 vaccine being developed
by Moderna in MA.

## Gene Drug(s) for C9orf72 Mutation

Biogen has BIIB078 gene drug in Phase I trials
Not until Phase 3 is completed, the efficacy and
drug dose is not confirmed.  Any gene silencing
drug, one of which is BIIB078, is administered
via a lumbar puncture.  In the Phase I trial
10 lumbar punctures are scheduled for one year.
Such gene drugs do not silence the gene forever.
One has to take the drug for life.  This means,
10 or more lumbar punctures every year for
rest of your life unless another form of
drug is developed.  Others forms are
infusion using the arm or oral medications.
Other forms a less likely because the ALS drug
molecule changes its structure if infused
via the arm and the drug bcecomes useless.


## Anaylze your Speech for Early Detection of ALS?

There are two kinds of ALS, viz., Bulbar and Limb.

Bulbar ALS affects muscle degradation for functions above the neck.  These functions are speech, swallowing and breathing.  Actually breathing uses lungs which are below the neck. I am not sure what are tests exist to detect bulbar early, but speech analysis seems like a good one.   

However, if one has Limb ALS which usually starts with a foot drop in one leg, speech is not impacted immediately.  So, in such ALS, speech analysis is not necessary, but can speech should be monitored.  

Bottom line is if EMG test detects fasciculations in multiple limbs, it is likely the person has motor neuron disease. So blood tests should be undertaken for C9orf72 first and then SOD1.  If both turn out to be negative, try FUS gene testing.  Your neurologist may know of other genes to test.  

## Other Drugs (Riluzole and Radicava)

On seeing an ALS patient for the first time, a neurologist always recommends Riluzole.  Riluzole was the first drug to treat ALS and get FDA approved in 1995. If Riluzole was so effective, why are ALS patients still dying in 3-5 years of ALS onset?  Credible public data shows Riluzole may increase life by a few months.

Ravdicava was FDA approved in 2017 and includes anti-oxidants.  Nothing more is known about it.  Radicava starts with a 6-month cycle after which slow down of ALS has been seen in trials.  Radicava has a side effect - it may degrade the patient's walking gait.  If a patient doesn't have access to gene drugs or other personalized medicine (Tregs, stem cells), Radicava should be considered.  A hospital such as MGH in Boston, takes 12 weeks to setup Radicava infusions.  The infusions can also be administered at home - consider this option during Covid-19 pandemic.

## Exercise 

### Strenthen Hip Flexors

Limb ALS weakens hip flexor muscles. If these muscles are weak, raising leg or getting up from chair/bed would be difficult.

1. Hold on to a chair and do marching.  March both legs and repeat 10 times - this is one set. Repeat set two more times.  See https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/Pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=zm2304&lang=en-ca
2. Toe Stand.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04zZLGcrN5Y
   Do 10 times which is one set.  Repeat the set two more times.

### Deep Breathing

Yoga recommends 100 deep breaths in one day.
