# Diagnosed with ALS?

## Next Step

Likely, an EMG test and other limb or bulbar physical tests concluded one has ALS.
But still, get your blood tested for gene mutation. Any one of many
gene mutatations in one's body cause ALS.  The C9orf72 gene is the
most common gene causing ALS.  A blood test for it takes about
3-4 weeks. Other genes causing ALS are SOD1 and FUS, there are
many more.  Speed of ALS research is picking up. The C9orf72 gene
mutation was discovered in 2011.  A test for this
mutation was developed in 2012 by Athena Diagnostics in the U.S.
and Phase I gene drug trials started in 2019.

## Tested Positive for gene mutation

SOD1 has a gene silencing drug from https://apic-bio.com/, a
company in MA with Dr. Robert Brown as one founder.  Dr. Brown
discovered the SOD1 gene around 1992 to cause ALS.  He has
been working tirelessly on finding cures for ALS. Merit Cudkowicz
has been a student of Dr. Brown's.  In 2006, gene silencing, invented
at UMass Medical, got the Nobel prize in medicine.  In 2008, Dr. Brown
left Harvard Medical and joined UMass Medical - he knew, familial ALS,
or even sporadic ALS, is caused by gene mutation and he would use gene
silencing knowledge at UMass Medical. See Dr. Brown's research on ALS below.

Dr. Brown is first with a mRNA drug for SOD1 gene mutation.
mRNA is also being used for Covid-19 vaccine being developed
by Moderna in MA.

## Gene Drug(s) for C9orf72 mutation

Biongen has BIIB078 gene drug in Phase I trials
Not until Phase 3 is completed, the efficacy and
drug dose is not confirmed.  Any gene silencing
drug, one of which is BIIB078, is administered
via a lumbar puncture.  In the Phase I trial
10 lumbar punctures are scheduled for one year.
Such gene drugs do not silence the gene forever.
One has to take the drug for life.  This means,
10 or more lumbar punctures every year for
rest of your life unless another form of
drug is developed.  Others forms are
infusion using the arm or oral medications.
Other forms a less likely because the ALS drug
molecule changes is structure if infused
via the arm and the drug bcecomes useless.
